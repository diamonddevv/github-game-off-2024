# actual game
- arcade of some description
- platforming
- set on alien planet(s?) (like risk of rain? but less action-oriented) 
- space pirate
- random planet parameters and quirks
- find parts to ship
- run 'ends' when you escape planet or something like that
- (optional) speedrun timer. (like celeste) faster == better obvs
- dialogue system
- pirate is overprotective of the flag every time
  - several flag designs but we colour them pride flag colors (or france)
    - pirate is canonically lgbtq (all of them)
  - dialogue says "ARRRRRRRRRRRRRR ME FLAGGGGGGGG"
- 'secrets' interpreted as working out the secrets of the planet's environment
  - also easter eggs and stuff
  - (NOT REQUIRED. EXTRA THING) secrets also could be my wildcard idea from before?
    - some roguelite intra-run upgrade thing?
      - every run you pick a wildcard twist (of which is actually a secret)
      -

  - [ ] items
  - [ ] crafting
- [ ] spaceship
- [ ] dialogue
- [ ] game name
- [ ] music
- [ ] sfx


## gameplay loop or something
- the player, a space pirate, crash land on an alien planet (goal is to be randomly generated eventually)
- ship breaks obviously and several parts of it go missing around the planet
- player has to determine the "quirks" of the planet, find the ship parts, repair the ship and escape the planet
  - "quirks" (im gonna call it that) are a few of a randomly picked parameters to a planet
    - these can be things like weather patterns, planetary composition, gravity
    - these can be worked out, or items can be crafted to test parameters to save the player getting hurt
    - to begin with, i dont plan on creating enemies and instead focus on a hostile _environment_ over anything else
    - this is the interpretation of the theme
  - ship parts will always include a flag, and probably 4 other things from a list
    - things like motors, fuel cores, engines, doors, silly stuff
  - crafting materials will be elements and stuff like:
    - metals like: tin, iron, gold, copper, aluminium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, lithium, etc.
    - fuels like: nuclear fuel, batteries
    - rocks of various descriptions
    - possibly gases and liquids
- there may be NPCs at some point.
- gameplay is arcade-like;
  - the goal is to escape as fast as possible, but also without taking much damage
  - rounds/runs are intended to be played in succession, but dont last too long
    - possibly some roguelike elements
  - 
- inspired by games like: risk of rain, no mans sky, subnautica
- not all of this will probably get done this month.


## secrets
- quirks are not immediate on a planet. this gives time for the player to work out what they may be, and prepare
- quirk types:
  - weather
  - gravity
  - color
  - available resources
  - water levels
  - atmospheric conditions

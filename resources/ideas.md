# actual game
- arcade of some description
- platforming
- set on alien planet(s?) (like risk of rain? but less action-oriented) 
- space pirate
- random planet parameters and quirks
- find parts to ship
- run 'ends' when you escape planet or something like that
- (optional) speedrun timer. (like celeste) faster == better obvs
- dialogue system
- pirate is overprotective of the flag every time
  - several flag designs but we colour them pride flag colors (or france)
    - pirate is canonically lgbtq (all of them)
  - dialogue says "ARRRRRRRRRRRRRR ME FLAGGGGGGGG"
- 'secrets' interpreted as working out the secrets of the planet's environment
  - also easter eggs and stuff
  - (NOT REQUIRED. EXTRA THING) secrets also could be my wildcard idea from before?
    - some roguelite intra-run upgrade thing?
      - every run you pick a wildcard twist (of which is actually a secret)
      -
